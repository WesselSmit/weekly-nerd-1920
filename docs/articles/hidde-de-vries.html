			<h2>Modernism and simplifying everything</h2>

			<p>Hidde talked about how in the current web standard function is above form. A trend that started with
				modernism.</p>

			<p>On the web the possibilities are limitless and it's a shame that nowadays most developers like to play it
				safe. Websites nowadays are all very similar and as developers we should aim more for the wow-effect on
				the web!</p>

			<p>Internet follows in the footsteps of modernism; modernism simplifies everything constantly. Take company
				logo's for example, these have increasingly changed from illustrations to calligraphic letters, these
				have been simplified over and over. Today, most logos look like the KLM logo
				below; safe & boring.</p>

			<h2>The current web</h2>

			<p>More and more is possible with modern technologies and newer features, which is increasingly visible on
				the web as companies play it safe. For example, they use the older but better supported features to
				create their websites because this works for most people in the browser. Hidde emphasizes that this is
				the wrong method; use the newer technologies and use fallbacks if necessary.</p>

			<p>Do not compromise the design, but offer alternatives where necessary.</p>

			<q>The web is accessible, flexible & interactive by default</q>

			<p>The web standards strive for a web that is usable for everyone, so Hidde's biggest takeaway to us was:
				stay as close to the standards as possible, try to do as much vanilla as possible. When you write
				semantic HTML, your application already has a very strong foundation for accessibility; your website is
				tablable, screen readers can interpret the content well & basic interactions are possible!</p>

			<h2>Notes:</h2>

			<h3>Graphic design for the web</h3>

			<q>We used to have to hack everything together and now we don't have to</q>

			<h5>Modernism in graphic design</h5>

			<ul>
				<li>clarity instead of beauty</li>
				<li>function over form</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Attention must be drawn from element to element</p>

			<p>One size fits all! = True</p>

			<p>You have to look at each problem individually</p>

			<ul>
				<p>From Â± 1920 until now everything is becoming simpler / modernist</p>
				<li>functional is important</li>
				<li>exciting design is less important</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<p>Flexbox & Grid</p>
				<li>equal heights are easy</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<p>White space & Placement</p>
				<li>with grid you can also keep the lines empty</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Create new compositions (layouts) for different canvas sizes</p>

			<p>To support older browsers; use @supports with fallbacks instead of compromising the design for modern
				browsers</p>

			<p>Keep your fallbacks as simple as possible</p>

			<q>Web design is engineering, it's not about finding perfection; it's about finding the best compromise</q>

			<h5>The web by default</h5>

			<ul>
				<p>The web is flexible by default</p>
				<li>content (styles) are easy to adjust</li>
				<li>use min, max, minmax, ch, fit, maxfit, minfit etc.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<p>The web is accessible by default</p>
				<li>copy/paste</li>
				<li>screenreaders</li>
				<li>translate (google)</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<p>The web is interactive by default</p>
				<li>hide/show content</li>
				<li>transitions</li>
				<li>it pays off to stay true to the standards</li>
				<li>try to keep it as vanilla as possible</li>
			</ul>
