			<p>This weekly nerd was a workshop at Funda; for example, in small groups we tried to make a small feature
				for the Funda website using a scrum method.</p>

			<h2>Assignment</h2>

			<p>The task of my team (team 4); create the value check search function. a result must be found & shown by
				means of a postcode and house number. In itself, this is not a very difficult task, after all, we can
				use the database that Funda already has. The challenge in this assignment is teamwork;
				for example, we had to appoint someone from our group as a scrum master.</p>

			<p>The scrum master had to guide our group in the right direction; ensure that everyone had something to do,
				set priorities, ensure that the different groups work together in a coordinated manner to be able to
				show a result after 2 hours.</p>

			<h2>Issues</h2>

			<p>This was of course a huge challenge; to learn to lead a small project in such a short time, while
				everyone is doing their own thing like chickens without a head. This turned out to have been the
				intention all along, Lars explained that despite all the chaos (time limit, new people in your group, JS
				framework with which no one has experience & are led by a fellow student). you have to work together as
				a team to succeed.</p>

			<p>Ultimately, I was involved in transforming the input data & matching it to a household in the database.
				Because the assignment was very small, there were not enough tasks to be divided among a group of 10
				students. This meant that some students decided not to try something themselves, but started to look
				over someone's shoulder and give suggestions. This can be quite frustrating and immediately showed
				why good leadership / management is so important.

			<h2>Result</h2>

			<p>Ultimately, we were able to complete the assignment and we had a result to show as long as the user
				enters a household (existing in the funda database). However, we did not have enough time to complete
				the other part of the assignment; linking a new design to the page, this was due to git complications &
				the fact that we tried to merge everything too late.</p>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>

			<p>Despite all the chaos, I would say that we still tried out hardest, although I think there is a lot of
				room
				for improvement. Ultimately delivered a result and technically fulfilled the assignment albeit a very
				insecure and definitely not waterproof product. We also worked together as a team; smaller groups worked
				on different parts that were eventually put together to form one product / feauture.</p>

			<h3>If we had to do it again</h3>

			<ul>
				<p>If we had to do it again I would do a few things differently:</p>
				<li>although with only 2 hours it is very tempting to start right away, I would take a bit more time
					to set up the project. This means discussing who can do what (who knows about Vue, who can do JS
					etc.), dividing the tasks according to everyone's skills, ensure that the git environment is ready
					and that everyone has a branch to work on.</li>
				<li>discuss deadlines and try to stick to them strictly, it is important that everyone knows what his /
					her priorities are. In order to achieve this, good and close collaboration must be discussed with
					the scrum master. </li>
				<li>Have a backup person / team that you can deploy if a department is slacking or falling behind. This
					way you can flexibly absorb the heavier blows and prevent large backlogs.</li>
				<li>be honest and express frustration should they arise. This way you avoid hating your co-workers and
					not wanting to work with them on the project.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>

			<p>The workshop was primarily designed to test our coordination and teamwork in a stressful new context. For
				a group of students who are not used to working in groups and were thrown into the deep, we did
				well!</p>
