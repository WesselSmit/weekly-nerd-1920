			<h2>Three definitions of micro-interaction by Dan Saffer</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>A signature moment in a digital product</li>
				<li>A product based around one micro-interaction</li>
				<li>People see interaction with a digital product as a series of micro-interactions</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Micro-interactions are used to make website memorable & pleasurable, micro-interactions should improve
				the user experience and so it's very important to know who the enduser is and understand their needs.

			<h2>Micro-interactions</h2>

			<p>The most important factor in micro-interactions is timing, specifically "sense of movement".
				Micro-interactions should not last too long because it then becomes tedious and forces the user to wait.
				"Sense of movement" is how the course of a micro-interaction feels; it's also called the easing.
				According to Sanne you should never use a linear easing because it looks unnatural, in nature there is
				nothing that goes exactly linear and so it will always feel like it was made with a computer (which of
				course is true).
			</p>

			<p>Personally I don't agree with Sanne. First of all there are definitely cases for linear easings,
				sometimes something is meant to feel robotic / computer made. Secondly, there most certainly are things
				in nature that are linear; it actually is how we <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second#%22Atomic%22_second" target="blank">measure time</a>. The
				very definition of a second is determined by atoms emitting energy, in fact it's so reliable we've been
				using it as the standard for a second since <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time#History" target="blank">1956</a>.

			<h2>Examples</h2>

			<p>Most of the college was Sanne explaining how he made a <a
					href="https://www.sinds1971.nl/fvd/rondje/index.html" target="blank">carousel generator</a> with a
				lot of micro-interactions and him showcasing some micro-interaction rich projects from his freshman
				students. The goal of showing all these different projects was for them to serve as (not very) subtle
				examples of how you can improve the user experience using micro-interactions.</p>

			<p>Sanne has a website wehere you can <a href="https://www.sinds1971.nl/fvd/rondje/index.html"
					target="blank">generate carousels</a>. If you adjust the properties of the carousel panels, the
				associated icons
				also change in the interface. For example, you can keep the corners rounded or sharp, the icons
				in the interface also get rounded / sharp corners. These are small changes that don't add much; after
				all, the functionality is the same. But the user experience is better and it is more fun to use the
				application.</p>

			<p>Sanne also showed the work of a handful of first year students, at first I was very impressed with their
				animation skills because some of the animations looked superb. However, it later turned out that the
				animations were made in dreamwaver and later exported to CSS. Still very cool to see what was made
				and a nice source of inspiration about how small micro-interactions can improve your websites.</p>


			<p>You can find the projects he showed <a href="https://www.sinds1971.nl/spelenmetcss/index.html"
					target="blank">here</a>, he also has his own website which you can find <a
					href="https://www.sinds1971.nl" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

			<h2>Notes:</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>A signature moment in a digital product</li>
				<li>A product based around one micro-interaction</li>
				<li>People see interaction with a digital product as a series of micro-interactions</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Every micro-interaction should be good</p>

			<p>Trigger --> rules --> feedback --> loops & modes</p>

			<p>Try to understand the user needs</p>

			<p>Functions --> delight makes something good</p>
